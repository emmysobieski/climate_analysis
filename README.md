# June Analysis

June temperatures average 75 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.25, with a 21 degree range of 64-85.  There were 1,700 datapoints, so plenty to make assumptions from.  Looking at the percentiles, temperatures are between 73-77 nearly half of the time (representing the second and third quartile) meaning that for starting a business, you can count on very reliable temperature ranges in June most years.

# December Analysis

December temperatures average 71 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.74, with a 27 degree range of 56-83.  There were 1,517 datapoints, so plenty to make assumptions from.  Looking at the percentiles, temperatures are between 69-74 nearly half of the time (representing the second and third quartile) meaning that for starting a business, you can count on very reliable temperature ranges in December most years.

# June vs December Comparison

It appears from the temperature data that a year round business would be very feasable.  There is slightly more variation in temperatures in December vs June, but both average temperatures and temperatures in the second and third quartiles are great temperatures for surfing and beach activity.  In fact, some vacationers prefer cooler beach temperatures, so might prefer the wintertime, even though there is also a bit more variability.  Even though the range of temperatures in December is higher, 27 degrees vs 21 degree range in June, the middle of the range (the second and third quartile) is 4 degrees in June and 5 degrees in December, meaning that most of the time the weather does not vary much, either in June or December, although the average is 4 degrees lower in December.  Funnily enough, when you just take the middle quartiles, the range is 3-4 degrees higher in June vs December for those quartiles.  Thus, with the mean and middle quartiles all being 3-4 degrees cooler in December, the real difference with December is the outliers, the days where you could have a cold front or storm come through.  For business planning then you could have a more reliable business in the summer vs winter, but in general Hawaii is one of the best places to run a year round outdoor business.

# Additional Studies Recommended

Looking back at the work done prior, specifically the weather printout of precipitation data and the associated histogram, you can see that there is quite a bit of variability in precipitation month to month, and even year to year, where some years the precipitation is associated with the height of both summer and winter, and other years the precipitation is spread more evenly across the year.

For instance: precipitation averages 0.17 of an inch per day, with a standard deviation of 0.46, so the variabiity is high vs the mean.  The max rain in a day is 6.7 inches which would not be ideal for a surfing vacation.

# Recommended additional analyses:

(1) Add additional months for temperature study, as June and December may not be fully representative of winter and summer.  Grab data from each month and run a chart of temperature by month.

(2) Combine data on precipitation and temperature, and then categorize each by month, so that you can get a fuller view of the weather.  It is not helpful that December is only 4 degrees cooler than June if it is raining every day.  That would make the comparison come more into view if you can see what the probability of rain each month is.

(3) Grab surf and wave data.  If you are running a surfing supply company, then you want to know the surf conditions by month, year round and then combine those with temperature and precipitation.

(4) Look at location specific data.  Especially in Hawaii, you may want to drill down on precipitation data as some islands have wetter and dryer parts by a large margin.  Once you know the location of the business you can localize the weather averages by month as well as the surf conditions which are location dependent.
